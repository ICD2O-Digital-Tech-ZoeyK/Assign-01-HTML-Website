            <p>The Hederodotiformes are a fascinating order of sharks, commonly known as carpet sharks. These sharks are recognized for their unique appearance, with broad, flat bodies and long, flexible pectoral fins. These sharks are typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, where they use their incredible camouflage to blend into the ocean floor.</p>

            <h2>Notable Species in the Hederodotiformes Order:</h2>

            <h3>Wobbegong Shark</h3>
            <p>The Wobbegong (family Orectolobidae) is a type of carpet shark found in the waters around Australia and Southeast Asia. These sharks are known for their unique, flattened bodies and long, bushy lobes on their heads, which help them camouflage on the ocean floor.</p>

            <h3>Whale Shark</h3>
            <p>While the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is the largest shark in the world, it is also part of the carpet shark family. Known for their massive size, these gentle giants are filter feeders, primarily feeding on plankton, small fish, and other tiny marine creatures.</p>

            <h3>Banded Wobbegong</h3>
            <p>The Banded Wobbegong (Orectolobus halei) is another species within the Hederodotiformes order, and itâ€™s famous for its distinctively patterned body. These sharks can grow up to 3 meters in length and are typically found in coastal and deep-water environments.</p>

            <h3>Other Species</h3>
            <p>In addition to the Wobbegong and Whale Sharks, the Hederodotiformes order includes several other species of carpet sharks, each of which is unique in its appearance and behavior. They are typically bottom dwellers and are known for their stealth and patience as they hunt for prey.</p>
