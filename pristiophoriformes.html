            <p>Pristiophoriformes, commonly known as sawsharks, are a fascinating group of sharks that are instantly recognizable by their long, flattened, and toothy snouts, which resemble saw blades. These sharks use their saw-like rostrum to detect and stun prey, often skimming the seafloor for small fish and invertebrates. They are found in both shallow coastal waters and deeper ocean environments.</p>

            <h2>Notable Species in the Pristiophoriformes Order:</h2>

            <h3>Common Sawshark (Pristiophorus cirratus)</h3>
            <p>The Common Sawshark, also known as the Australian Sawshark, is one of the most well-known species in the Pristiophoriformes order. It is native to the coast of Australia, where it is found at depths of around 200 meters. The sawshark uses its long, toothed snout to detect electrical signals from its prey, such as fish and crustaceans. They can grow up to 1.5 meters long and are relatively harmless to humans.</p>

            <h3>Elongate Sawshark (Pristiophorus schroederi)</h3>
            <p>The Elongate Sawshark is a species found in the deeper waters off the coast of Japan. Known for its long, narrow body and saw-like rostrum, it hunts by sweeping its snout from side to side, disorienting and stunning prey. The Elongate Sawshark is a bottom-dwelling species that uses its saw to unearth small fish and invertebrates from the seafloor.</p>

            <h3>Other Species</h3>
            <p>Other species in the Pristiophoriformes order include the Japanese Sawshark and the South African Sawshark. These sharks are similar in appearance, with long, tooth-lined rostra and slender bodies. They are found in a range of depths, from shallow coastal waters to deeper oceanic environments. Despite their intimidating appearance, sawsharks are not a significant threat to humans.</p>
