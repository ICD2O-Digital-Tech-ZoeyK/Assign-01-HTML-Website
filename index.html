            <p>Sharks come in many diverse forms, categorized into several different orders. These include Carcharhiniformes, known for species like the bull shark, Hederodotiformes, and many more. Letâ€™s explore these fascinating groups:</p>

            <h2>Carcharhiniformes</h2>
            <p>The Carcharhiniformes are a diverse group of sharks, including some of the most well-known species like the bull shark, sandbar shark, and blacktip shark. These sharks are primarily found in coastal waters and have a wide range of ecological roles.</p>

            <h2>Hederodotiformes</h2>
            <p>Hederodotiformes is a small order that includes the carpet sharks. These sharks have distinctive flattened bodies and are primarily found in tropical waters. They are notable for their ability to adapt to different marine environments.</p>

            <h2>Hexanchiformes</h2>
            <p>Hexanchiformes includes some of the most primitive sharks. Known for having six or seven gill slits, they are often referred to as "cow sharks" due to their unique features. They inhabit deep waters and are rarely seen.</p>

            <h2>Lamniformes</h2>
            <p>The Lamniformes includes some of the most iconic and powerful sharks, like the great white shark, mako shark, and thresher shark. These sharks are known for their speed and agility in the ocean.</p>

            <h2>Orectolobiformes</h2>
            <p>Orectolobiformes, also known as carpet sharks, are characterized by their distinctive body shapes and unusual feeding behavior. This group includes the wobbegong and the whale shark, the largest fish in the world.</p>

            <h2>Pristiophoriformes</h2>
            <p>Pristiophoriformes, or saw sharks, are notable for their elongated, saw-like snouts. These sharks use their unique snouts to detect and capture prey along the ocean floor.</p>

            <h2>Squaliformes</h2>
            <p>Squaliformes includes species like the dogfish sharks. These sharks are often small and adaptable, living in a variety of ocean habitats from coastal waters to deep-sea regions.</p>

            <h2>Squatiniformes</h2>
            <p>Squatiniformes, or angel sharks, are unique for their flattened, ray-like bodies. They are ambush predators, hiding in the sand and waiting for prey to swim by.</p>
