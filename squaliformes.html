            <p>The Squaliformes order of sharks is a fascinating group of species that primarily inhabit deep-sea environments. These sharks are known for their long, slender bodies, sharp teeth, and unique adaptations that allow them to thrive in the dark depths of the ocean. Squaliformes sharks are often characterized by their rough texture and are typically smaller in size compared to other shark orders.</p>

            <h2>Notable Species in the Squaliformes Order:</h2>

            <h3>Spiny Dogfish (Squalus acanthias)</h3>
            <p>The Spiny Dogfish is one of the most well-known species in the Squaliformes order. This small shark is easily recognized by its two dorsal spines, which it uses for defense. Spiny Dogfish are found in both shallow coastal waters and deep ocean environments. They are known for their resilience and can live up to 40 years in the wild.</p>

            <h3>Greenland Shark (Somniosus microcephalus)</h3>
            <p>The Greenland Shark is a large, slow-moving species that inhabits the cold waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. It is one of the longest-living vertebrates, with some individuals living for over 400 years. Greenland Sharks are known for their sluggish movements and are primarily scavengers, feeding on fish, seals, and even whale carcasses.</p>

            <h3>Other Species</h3>
            <p>Other species in the Squaliformes order include the Portuguese Dogfish and the Rough Shark. These sharks are typically found in deep waters and are adapted to survive in harsh environments where food is scarce. Their long, sharp teeth help them catch and consume a variety of prey, including fish and invertebrates.</p>
